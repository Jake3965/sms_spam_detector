### I had to re-load gradio because it was not workign properly at the start.
### Utilized Co-Polit and ChatGPT 4.o to help debug code.
### My McAfee Virus Protection would not allow me to create a public URL for Gradio. 
### Took Screen shots of APP with the 4 questions required to enter and attached screenshots into Repo.
### Finally, I took down my Virus Protection and created a public URL.
### I tested all 4 questions on the public URL, which states is only up for 72 hours. git status
### Running on public URL: https://60d9dc92cd620c8125.gradio.live
